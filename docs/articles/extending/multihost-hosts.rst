Multihost Hosts
###############

:class:`~pytest_mh.MultihostHost` has access to the host part of the
configuration file. Its main purpose is to setup and teardown the host and
prepare it to run the tests and provide access to the main connection to the
host over which is it possible to run commands on the host (see
:attr:`~pytest_mh.MultihostHost.conn` attribute).

The host objects are created once when pytest starts and live for the whole
duration of the pytest session. Therefore they can be used to store data that
should be available to all tests.

.. note::

    The host class can be also used to provide high-level API for your project,
    however remember that the test has direct access to the
    :class:`MultihostRole` objects and only indirect access to the host objects
    (via the role). Therefore vast majority of your high-level API should be
    placed in the role object in order to provide most direct access.

    There are several methods where you can place your setup and teardown code.
    See :doc:`../life-cycle/setup-and-teardown`.

    The host class is a perfect place to implement host-level backup and
    teardown. See :doc:`../tips-and-tricks/backup-restore` for tips on how to
    achieve that with :class:`~pytest_mh.MultihostBackupHost`.

It is also possible to add custom configuration options or further extend
functionality by overriding the parent class methods. The configuration
dictionary can be accessed by :attr:`~pytest_mh.MultihostHost.confdict`, however
it is recommended to place custom options under the ``config`` field which can
by accessed through the :attr:`~pytest_mh.MultihostHost.config` attribute. This
way, it is possible to avoid collisions if pytest-mh introduces new options in
the future.
