Getting Started
###############

Pytest-mh is not a plugin to support unit testing. It is a plugin designed to
support testing your application as a complete product, this is often referred
to as a black-box, application or system testing. The application is installed
on the target host and tested there by running commands on the host (and on
other hosts that are required). These hosts can be virtual machines or
containers.

.. seealso::

    SSH, podman and docker may be used to execute commands on the remote hosts. See
    :doc:`running-commands` for more information.

As such, it is often useful to write a high level API that will support testing
your application and make your test smaller and more readable. This may require
a non-trivial initial investment, but it will pay off in the long run. However,
implementing such API is not required and it is perfectly possible to run
commands on the host directly from each test. That, however, makes tests usually
larger and more difficult to understand and maintain -- but every project is
different and it is up to you to choose how are you going to test your
application.

.. seealso::

    Pytest-mh provides several building blocks to help you design your test
    framework. See :doc:`extending`. **It would be good to open this document
    and read it side by side.**

We will use `sudo <https://www.sudo.ws/>`__ as the application to test for this
getting started guide as sudo is known by every power user so changes are that
you are already familiar with it. Additionally, sudo tests allows us to show
many pytest-mh features. Note, that these tests were written only as an example
and sudo itself is not using pytest-mh for its tests at this moment and there
are no plans to do so.

.. seealso::

    The example code can be found in the `example
    <https://github.com/next-actions/pytest-mh/tree/master/example>`__ folder of
    the git repository.

Example project: sudo
=====================

`Sudo <https://www.sudo.ws/>`__ is a widely known tool that can elevate current
user's privileges by running command as different user -- usually ``root``. It
is possible to write a set of rules to define which user can run which command
and these rules can be stored either locally in ``/etc/sudoers`` or in `LDAP
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol>`__
database.

Our goals are:

* write basic tests

  * allow user run all commands, user must authenticate
  * allow user run all commands, without authentication
  * allow user run all commands if he or she is a member of a group, user must authenticate
  * allow user run all commands if he or she is a member of a group, without authentication

* these tests must be written for all possible sources of data

  * file: ``/etc/sudoers``
  * LDAP pulled directly by sudo
  * LDAP pulled by SSSD

* write a simple test framework that will help us to extend the tests easily
* every change must be reverted after each test

As you can see, these goals require us to write 12 tests in total. But since the
result is the same and only the data is fetched from different sources, we can
use :ref:`topology parametrization <topology_parametrization>`. Topology
parametrization will allow us to write only for tests but run them against
different backends and thus we will do less work but get more code coverage.

We will take the following steps to achieve it:

#. :ref:`get_started_structure`
#. :ref:`get_started_topologies`
#. :ref:`get_started_config_file`
#. :ref:`get_started_config_domain`
#. :ref:`get_started_framework`
#. :ref:`get_started_enable`
#. :ref:`get_started_write_tests`
#. :ref:`get_started_run_tests`

.. _get_started_structure:

Prepare a file structure
------------------------

The following snippet shows a recommended file structure for your test utilizing
pytest-mh. Look at :doc:`extending` to get more information about the meaning of
individual classes.

.. _get_started_topologies:

Define multihost topologies
---------------------------

This is the first step when designing a test framework since it tells you what
hosts and roles your project needs. For sudo, we want to that that the sudo
rules can be fetched from different sources. We can consider each data source to
be a single topology.

* **sudoers**

  * we only need one host
  * users, groups and sudo rules will be created locally

* **ldap**

  * we need a host where we will run sudo and a host that runs an LDAP server
  * users, groups and sudo rules will be added to the LDAP database
  * sudo will read data from LDAP

* **sssd**

  * we need a host where we will run sudo and SSSD and a host that runs an LDAP server
  * SSSD will be connected to the LDAP domain
  * users, groups and sudo rules will be added to the LDAP database
  * sudo will read data from SSSD which reads it from LDAP

These are the three topologies that we will define. We will also define a
topology group as a shortcut for :ref:`topology parametrization
<topology_parametrization>`.

                :language: python

.. _get_started_config_file:

Write configuration file
------------------------

The topologies defines which hosts and roles are needed to run sudo test. We can
convert it into a configuration file that can be used to run all sudo tests.

The configuration file will define one domain with two hosts - one ``client``
which will run sudo and SSSD and one ``ldap`` which will run the LDAP server.

.. seealso::

    The full format of the configuration file can be found at :doc:`mhc-yaml`.

            .. literalinclude:: ../../example/mhc.yaml
                :language: yaml

.. _get_started_config_domain:

Define :class:`~pytest_mh.MultihostConfig` and :class:`~pytest_mh.MultihostDomain`
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These two classes are required to correctly map the configuration file into your
Python code. Look for more information at :doc:`extending/multihost-config` and
:doc:`extending/multihost-domains`. It is possible to extend these classes in
order to add custom configuration options, use different topology mark and so
on. In this example, they only provide the mapping from configuration file to
Python classes.

            .. literalinclude:: ../../example/framework/config.py
                :language: python

.. _get_started_framework:

Design and implement the framework
----------------------------------

This part is rather more complicated and can not be treated universally as every
project have different needs. It is possible to use multiple building block
provided by pytest-mh in order to built a high-level API for your tests, see
:doc:`extending` and :doc:`life-cycle` to get a good grasp of all the classes
and how to use them.

For the sudo tests, we have implemented several hosts, roles and utility classes
and one topology controller for each topology. The following table describes the
main idea behind each of these classes.

.. dropdown:: See the table

    Look at the `example code
    <https://github.com/next-actions/pytest-mh/tree/master/example>`__ to see
    how this was implemented.

.. _get_started_enable:

Enable pytest-mh in conftest.py
-------------------------------

When the test framework is written and read to use, we can tell pytest to start
using it in our tests. First, we tell pytest to load pytest-mh plugin and then
we tell pytest-mh which config class it should instantiate.

.. _get_started_write_tests:

Write the tests
===============

The example code shows four tests in total, but 12 tests are executed when
pytest is run because each test is run once per each topology against different
data source. See :doc:`writing-tests` to get more information on how to write
the tests.

  * allow user run all commands, user must authenticate
  * allow user run all commands, without authentication
  * allow user run all commands if he or she is a member of a group, user must authenticate
  * allow user run all commands if he or she is a member of a group, without authentication

.. _get_started_run_tests:

Run the tests
=============

The example code provides a set of containers that can be started up and used as
hosts for the tests. See the example `readme.md
<https://github.com/next-actions/pytest-mh/tree/master/example/readme.md>`__ to
get the instruction on how to start the containers and install requirements.

When the containers or virtual machines are ready, it is possible to run the
tests with ``pytest`` command that you are already familiar with. The only
additional thing needed to run pytest-mh tests is to provide path to the
pytest-mh configuration file with ``--mh-config``.
