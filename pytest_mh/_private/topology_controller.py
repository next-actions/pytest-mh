class TopologyController(Generic[ConfigType]):
    """
    Topology controller can be associated with a topology via TopologyMark
    to provide additional per-topology hooks such as per-topology setup
    and teardown.

    When inheriting from this class, keep it mind that there is postpone
    initialization of all present properties therefore you can not access
    them inside the constructor. The properties are initialized a test is
    collected.

    Each method can take MultihostHost object as parameters as defined in
    topology fixtures.

    Implements automatic backup and restore of all topology hosts that inherit
    from :class:`MultihostBackupHost`.

    The backup of all hosts is taken in :meth:`topology_setup`. It is expected
    that this method is overridden by the user to setup the topology
    environment. In such case, it is possible to call
    ``super().topology_setup(**kwargs)`` at the end of the overridden function
    or omit this call and store the backup in :attr:`backup_data` manually.

    :meth:`teardown` restores the hosts to the backup taken in
    :meth:`topology_setup`. This is done after each test, so each test starts
    with clear topology environment.

    When all tests for this topology are run, :meth:`topology_teardown` is
    called and the hosts are restored to the original state which backup was
    taken in :meth:`MultihostBackupHost.pytest_setup` so the environment is
    fresh for the next topology.

        It is possible to decorate methods, usually the custom implementation of
